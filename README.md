# Repository for 600.475 automated testing

Make a PR, post an issue, or send us a message if you have issues running this. 

## Usage:
```
./test.sh /path/to/your/code/folder/
```

Note that if you want to clear intermediate files produced by your runs (ie, if you wanted to just have the same repo for every homework, and are lazy like me and don't want to manually delete the model files and stuff in between, or just to reset the repo if you play around with the shell script), you can call:

```
git reset --hard origin/master
```

To reset the branch to the latest commit. 

## Disclaimers
 
This repo is not guaranteed to be up to date with homeworks on the day they come out (ie, it may not test the latest algorithm additions), but expect it to be generally updated within a day or two of each homework release.
